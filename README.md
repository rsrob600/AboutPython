# AboutPython
I've taken some liberties on this project to align, justify and improve the overall UIX as listed below:
 - Using the Logo & Login Box on the header I've centered and aligned the primary top navigation bar and left indent the secondary side navigation bar
 - Increased the font size and justify the content in the top main information box
 - Center align and justify the font and list in the lower content information boxes
 - center and align the footer navigation links
